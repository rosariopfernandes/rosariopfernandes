## App crashing in production? Firebase for the rescue!

An Exception's Stacktrace is one of the best ways to understand why an app crashed and to find a fix for it. But when the app crashes in a user's device, getting this stacktrace might require more time and effort, since the user might need to take some extra steps, such as enabling debug mode to provide us with the trace.
But what if we could improve our app quality in less time with less effort?

During this presentation, Rosário will be talking about the tools and services that Firebase provides for developers to better release and monitor mobile apps.

Expect to come out of the session with:
- an overview on tools such as Crashlytics, Test Lab, App Distribution & Performance Monitoring.
- (hopefully) a crash-free mobile app.

## :portugal: Firebase KTX: Porquê, O quê e Como?

Kotlin é agora a linguagem recomendada para o desenvovimento de apps Android. Apesar desta linguagem ter interroperabilidade com a linguagem Java, a equipe do Firebase lançou a biblioteca Firebase KTX que foi desenhada especificamente para ser usada em Kotlin.

Rosário participou da criação destas bibliotecas e irá explicar porquê elas foram criadas e como utilizá-las para ter código Kotlin mais idiomático e legível.

Você sairá da sessão com conhecimento de como utilizar o Firebase KTX em apps Android, como contribuir e como enviar feedback.

## A/B Testing Android Apps with Firebase

There are a lot of decisions developers need to make when developing an app, such as: selecting the best color for a button, how often an ad will be shown or how fast the protagonist of our game should run. While these might seem like small changes, they can make a huge influence on your app’s success when put together.

In this talk, Rosário will show you how to run A/B tests using Firebase, how to interpret the test results and the recommended actions to take based on those results.

Expect to come out of the session with knowledge on how Firebase Remote Config integrates with Google Analytics for Firebase to help you make better decisions for your app’s success.

## Firebase and Kotlin: Extensions, Coroutines and Flows

Android is now Kotlin-first, but most of the existing libraries and SDKs were written in Java.
Despite the effort that the Firebase team has put in coming up with KTX libraries for their Android SDK, there are still a few Kotlin features that have been missed out.

In this session, Rosário will talk about some of the features that are present in the KTX libraries and the features that you can implement yourself to get cleaner and more idiomatic  Kotlin code.

You’ll learn how Sequences, Sealed Classes, Coroutines and Asynchronous Flow can provide you with a kotlin-first experience when working with Firebase’s Android Java SDK.

## Firebase for Android

When developing apps, Android Developers may need to spend some time building infrastructure for their apps and managing different tools. But what if we could save this time and use pre-existing infrastructure in a single and unified platform?
In this talk, Rosário will give a quick overview of what Firebase is and how it simplifies the android app development process.
We’ll be seeing how to use Firebase Authentication to authenticate users into our app and how to store our user data in Cloud Firestore.
