## Single codebase, single backend & multiple apps with Flutter + Firebase

**Co-Speaker:** [Igor L. Sambo](https://github.com/LSambo02)

Building an app can be a complex task: besides coding, you'll also need a backend infrastructure to hold all of your user data and server-side logic. The task gets even harder if your app needs to be delivered on a tight schedule or when you simply don't have much time to spend on it.
But nowadays with backendless tools such as Firebase and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter, the app-building process can be much faster!

In this session, the speakers will show you how to create a Food Recipes app in 30 min and build it natively on Android, iOS and the Web.

Expect to come out of the session with:
- An overview on how to get started with Flutter.
- An overview of Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage and Firebase Hosting.
- (Hopefully) a good-looking Food Recipes app.

## Fix app crashes and slow response times with Firebase

Once we deploy an android app to production, its common to see our users complain about crashes, device incompatibility issues and/or slow response times. Tracking down each and all of these problems can be time-consuming and require a lot of effort from our side. But what if we could automate part of this monitoring process?

During this presentation, Rosário will be talking about the Firebase tools and services that can help developers monitor their android app releases.

Expect to come out of the session with:
- an overview on tools such as Crashlytics, Test Lab, Performance Monitoring & App Distribution.
- (hopefully) a crash-free mobile app.

## :portugal: Firebase KTX: Porquê, O quê e Como?

Kotlin é agora a linguagem recomendada para o desenvovimento de apps Android. Apesar desta linguagem ter interroperabilidade com a linguagem Java, a equipe do Firebase lançou a biblioteca Firebase KTX que foi desenhada especificamente para ser usada em Kotlin.

Rosário participou da criação destas bibliotecas e irá explicar porquê elas foram criadas e como utilizá-las para ter código Kotlin mais idiomático e legível.

Você sairá da sessão com conhecimento de como utilizar o Firebase KTX em apps Android, como contribuir e como enviar feedback.

## A/B Testing Android Apps with Firebase

There are a lot of decisions developers need to make when developing an app, such as: selecting the best color for a button, how often an ad will be shown or how fast the protagonist of our game should run. While these might seem like small changes, they can make a huge influence on your app’s success when put together.

In this talk, Rosário will show you how to run A/B tests using Firebase, how to interpret the test results and the recommended actions to take based on those results.

Expect to come out of the session with knowledge on how Firebase Remote Config integrates with Google Analytics for Firebase to help you make better decisions for your app’s success.

## Firebase and Kotlin: Extensions, Coroutines and Flows

Android is now Kotlin-first, but most of the existing libraries and SDKs were written in Java.
Despite the effort that the Firebase team has put in coming up with KTX libraries for their Android SDK, there are still a few Kotlin features that have been missed out.

In this session, Rosário will talk about some of the features that are present in the KTX libraries and the features that you can implement yourself to get cleaner and more idiomatic  Kotlin code.

You’ll learn how Sequences, Sealed Classes, Coroutines and Asynchronous Flow can provide you with a kotlin-first experience when working with Firebase’s Android Java SDK.

## Firebase for Android

When developing apps, Android Developers may need to spend some time building infrastructure for their apps and managing different tools. But what if we could save this time and use pre-existing infrastructure in a single and unified platform?
In this talk, Rosário will give a quick overview of what Firebase is and how it simplifies the android app development process.
We’ll be seeing how to use Firebase Authentication to authenticate users into our app and how to store our user data in Cloud Firestore.
